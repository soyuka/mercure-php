# Mercure php

This is a draft experimental implementation of the [mercure](mercure.rocks) protocol. Do not use this in any way and if you really want to use php use some more advanced work as [this mercure php hub](https://github.com/bpolaszek/mercure-php-hub).

This only implements only the publish and the subscribe endpoints with no features except the topic selection.

Just run `docker-compose up` after using `composer install`.
